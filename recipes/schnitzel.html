    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Chicken schnitzel is a breeze to make in the oven. Plus, this method uses less oil and has easier cleanup. The breaded chicken breasts are baked until golden and crispy on the outside, yet they're still tender and juicy on the inside. Serve schnitzels with lemon wedges and a German-style potato salad.</p>
        <p>Think you can't make chicken schnitzel without frying? Think again! This baked recipe imitates that deep-fried feel without using a ton of oil. All you need is to employ a couple simple hacks — heat the pan beforehand and drizzle the chicken with olive oil twice.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
    <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. Place the baking sheet in the oven as it preheats.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
